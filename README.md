# desktop-randy
Very rough desktop pet project made using PyQT. Not sure what I'm doing tbh. Maybe when I learn more software programming.

Go grab the download in the sidebar, I have no idea what to do with the build files haha...

# Documentation
Even though this is a really small project, I'll document the few functions I coded. Code is spaghetti, I have improved a lot since then. Whoops!

<b>Right click on him for more options and settings.</b>

You can drag Randy around and let him fall. You can also throw him into the air.

Sit still!/Be Free! - Toggle random movement

Catch my cursor! - He leaps after your cursor. He will take your cursor down with him. Yes, he moves your cursor.

---
### Settings
Disable Gravity - Randy won't fall after being dragged around on screen. You can place him anywhere. Movement follows the same logic. Cursor catching, however, puts him on top of your on-screen task bar again. (I have not tested what happens when your task bar isn't at the bottom of the screen)

Disable cursor stealing - Your cursor will not be taken down with him.

---
Debug - Nothing happens. Debug function has been removed.

Quit - He runs off the screen.

If Randy disappears when you change resolution/computer goes into sleep mode, on Windows (at least) you can go to the system tray, right click on the little Randy icon, and there are two options...

Reset Position - recalculates position of taskbar and puts him back on screen

Force Quit - force quits the application if you don't want to bother with Task Manager.
